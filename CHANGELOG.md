- Add support for Portuguese language (alongside existing support for English and simplified
  Chinese).
- Clear model context/memory when clearing the chat i.e. deleting all messages from the current
  chat.
- Avoid model reloading when screen is rotated.

### UI Improvements

- Earlier, the user had to click on the folder name to expand it. Clicking on the chevron icon now
  also expands the folder.
- Task names are now appended with `[Task]` in the chats list to distinguish them from other chats.
